# SGP_Data_Challenge_Maria_Tsaousidou
Hi,
I have included my answers and comments in the main.ipynb file. Each answer is accompanied by the corresponding code(s), which are organized by question number. The code for each question can be found in separate files, each named to correspond with the respective question.

For example:

    Question 1: The code for this is in the file named 2025_SGP (1) downsampling....ipynb.
    The rest of the questions follow a similar naming convention for clarity.

Let me know if you need any further clarification!
